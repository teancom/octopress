<div style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify;">
Originally hired as a Senior Systems Administrator, to help maintain and expand the linux infrastructure, support dozens of websites written in PHP and Perl, and provide technical direction for the group. Mentored other sysadmins on the use of puppet for maintaining servers. Integrated puppet into kickstart and almost all day-to-day tasks. Evangelized and trained release engineers, systems architects and developers on using puppet to automate installation and configuration. Completed expanding a central authentication system using ldap, with replication across four datacenters, to all machines and most internal web applications. Took over packaging duties, and expanded the number of packages built in-house from around 200 to over 1000. Integrated existing bind configuration with source control, wrote scripts to automate syntax checking, configured staging servers, and documented the process of releasing updated zone files, drastically reducing the frequency and impact of DNS errors. Helped expand from two datacenters to four, and more than doubling the number of servers from 600 to 1400, while the number of admins was reduced from eight to five. Was in a two-man 24&#215;7 oncall rotation for eight months, and during that time reduced the average number of calls from eight per weekend to two. Proposed, designed, and taught a course on Basic Linux Administration to operators in our NOC, including to two people who are now sysadmins on my team. Was the Systems representative in almost all architectural decisions made over the last two years. Currently the Lead Systems Administrator with six direct reports including all standard management responsibilities (approving PTOs, writing annual reviews, recommending promotions and pay raises/bonuses). Managed not only my team, but also the DBAs and the Storage Infrastructure team for six weeks this spring, reporting directly to the VP of IT, while my boss was out on medical leave. Received multiple performance-based bonuses, as well as additional stock option grants, outside of the annual review process.
