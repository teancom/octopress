Took over packaging duties, and expanded the number of packages built in-house from around 200 to over 2400. Integrated existing bind configuration with source control, wrote scripts to automate syntax checking, configured staging servers, and documented the process of releasing updated zone files, drastically reducing the frequency and impact of DNS errors.

Was in a two-man 24&#215;7 oncall rotation for eight months, and during that time reduced the average number of calls from eight per weekend to two. Proposed, designed, and taught a course on Basic Linux Administration to operators in our NOC, including two people who are now sysadmins on my team. Was the Systems representative in almost all architectural decisions made over the last five years. Currently the Lead Systems Administrator with seven direct reports including all standard management responsibilities (approving PTOs, writing annual reviews, recommending promotions and pay raises/bonuses). Managed not only my team, but also the DBAs and the Storage Infrastructure team for six weeks, reporting directly to the VP of IT, while my boss was out on medical leave. Received multiple performance-based bonuses, as well as additional stock option grants, outside of the annual review process.
