And I mean that in a clinical way.  Which is why it is almost never any use arguing with a [creationist](http://www.talkorigins.org), a [truther](http://www.debunking911.com/), a [birther](http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/birthcertificate.asp), a [global-warming denialist](http://www.grist.org/article/series/skeptics/), [moon landing hoaxer](http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/foxapollo.html), or an [anti-stratfordian](http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/tls_selections/literature_and_criticism/article7103578.ece).  That last link is the one I want to direct your attention to.  You've probably heard, vaguely, that there are theories that William Shakespeare didn't write "Shakespeare's" plays and poems.  You've probably not read or thought much about it.  The truth is, there is as much proof of that as there is that Obama is a Kenyan, or that Bush planned 9/11.  That is, not even a shred.
