[I love the sense of morality it brings to our every day lives.](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=1065017&mode=print) 

 Actually, this reminds me of a long-running argument I've had with my father. Apparently, if someone does something wrong, but they profess to be a Christian, that's because they aren't actually Christian and their actions shouldn't reflect poorly on Christianity.  Fair enough. However, it turns out Islam can't be a religion of peace, because look at those Muslim's that aren't peaceful! Grrr.
