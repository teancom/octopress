Horrifying, as you realize that [this actually happened to real people](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2004/05/a-sea-story/2940/).  And I have a real fear of drowning in deep water.  I hated the opening scenes of "Castaway", where the plane was sinking into the ocean.  That squicked me out more than most horror movies.
