So we've been watching the Olympics for the last few nights, and I have a few notes. 

1) Not to pile on with the hate, but the compulsory section of ice dancing, that is, watching couple after couple skate to the same song with the same choreography, is atomic-wedgie painful.   You know - nothing you can't live through, but not anything you'd like to ever repeat.

2) Googling for athlete names while watching events can inadvertently be spoiler-rific. The men's Super-G was a lot less involving once I accidentally discovered Bode got silver.

3) As I mentioned on Twitter, I will never in my life be as good at something as Shaun White is at snow boarding. If you missed his runs, you missed something special. 

4) Seriously, screw ice dancing.
