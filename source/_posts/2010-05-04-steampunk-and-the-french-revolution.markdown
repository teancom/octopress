Actually, not being a French speaker, I don't know if [this is more French Revolution or WWII French Resistance](http://www.lamaindesmaitres.com/en/player-hd.html).  Either way, it's lots of steam punk.  

Interestingly, it looks (to my untrained eye) as if the people were drawn in one style, and everything else (the backgrounds, costumes, etc.) somehow different.  Which might be my way of saying that the backgrounds and "everything else" is gorgeous, but the people are stiff, awkward, and jarringly un-lifelike.  But hey! Steampunk!
