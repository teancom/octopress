[from China](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/04/24/060424fa_fact6?currentPage=all), this time.  It's almost like a magic trick.  Watch carefully, as your favorite idea for reducing illegal immigration is tried - and it just makes things worse!  

As long as people look at the opportunity to pay $30,000 to huddle in cramped boats for weeks on end, subsisting on rice and dried vegetables, all in order to work long hours bussing tables and sewing clothes, and say to themselves, "Sounds good to me! Where do I sign up?", we're going to have illegal immigration.  I still fail to see the point in not letting whoever wants to move to America, move to America.  We don't have to beat 'em, if they join us.

Or, as I saw quipped earlier today, "White people: the original illegal immigrants."
