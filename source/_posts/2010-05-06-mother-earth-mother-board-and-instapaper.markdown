I came across a link to a [44,000 word "essay"](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.12/ffglass_pr.html) by [Neal Stephenson](http://www.nealstephenson.com/) about laying a [cable called FLAG from England to Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber-Optic_Link_Around_the_Globe).  I had read the article before, probably a decade or so ago (it came out in 1996) but reread it on a lark.  It's just as interesting now as it was then, if not even more so.  For one thing, I understand a lot more of the article nowadays.

But the real reason I'm posting the link is that it gives me a chance to link to [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/).  It's an app for any iPhone OS device that lets you download a copy of an article for later reading, generally with a more mobile-friendly format as well.  Highly recommended, it's how I read almost everything that I link to, if it's longer than a page or two of text.
