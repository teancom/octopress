Ze Frank is probably best known for [The Show](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/), a very funny short video program posted Monday through Friday for an entire year, ending in March of 2007.  However, he's been doing other stuff since then, including writing a "chillout" song (i.e., a song to listen to when you need to just chill out and stop stressing).  [Here's the story and the song](http://www.zefrank.com/chillout/).

Tip o' the hat to [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net) for the link.
