[Slacktivist in fine form.](http://www.patheos.com/community/slacktivist/2011/05/27/an-inescapable-network-of-mutuality/) 

I've said it before and I'll say it again. If you don't already read Fred Clark via RSS or whatever--if you're relying on me to send you to him--then you're missing out on some very fine thoughts on religion and politics.  Though Fred and I obviously disagree on some fundamental things (such as the reality of a god) I'm never not edified.
