As some of you know, I vacationed down in Jamaica last October with my wife.  It was fantastic.  One of the cooler things about the trip was learning a little of the patwa.  Of course, as white American tourists, us saying stuff like "No problem, mon!" in a fake Jamaican accent is pretty much the unhippest thing we could do, but we did it anyway (see: white American tourists).  Anyway, all of that was just to lead up to why I got such a kick out of [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zjtlLKPEWg).
