[Repeat after me: never trust that the justice system works.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/24/AR2006062401082_pf.html)  [Never talk to a cop](http://boingboing.net/2008/07/28/law-prof-and-cop-agr.html).  Never sign anything presented to you by a cop unless your lawyer has told you to. Never, ever, think that things will work themselves out because you're a good person and surely this is all just a big mistake.
