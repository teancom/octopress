I've been somewhat fascinated by the Freegan culture ever since I heard about it a couple of years ago, and [this article talks about an enclave here in Buffalo, NY](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/magazine/06Squatters-t.html?ref=magazine&pagewanted=all).  Very interesting - and make sure to read all the way to the end.
