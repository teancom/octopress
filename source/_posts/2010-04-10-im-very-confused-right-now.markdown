How have I never heard of a show that could get James Earl Jones, Leonard Nimoy, Robert Carradine, and Tim Freaking Burton for just [one episode](http://www.hulu.com/watch/112389/shelley-duvalls-faerie-tale-theatre-aladdin-and-his-wonderful-lamp)?  And, going off the opening credits, also pulled in Paul Reubens, Robin Williams, Mick Jagger, and Christopher Reeves!?

I only hope that Shelly Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre lives up to it's cast and crew, as I go off to wander through its six (6!) seasons...
