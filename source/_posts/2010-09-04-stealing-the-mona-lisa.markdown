Now I know where all of those cartoons from my childhood got their ["art theft" plots](http://www.vanityfair.com/style/features/2009/05/mona-lisa-excerpt200905?printable=true&currentPage=all).  I mean, how many times did I see the Beagle Boys try and steal the Mona Lisa, only to be foiled by Scrooge McDuck?
