I'm sure the [point of this video](http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/teabagger-meltdown-part-ii) is to make you think the woman is clinically insane (and she is), but I have almost as much dislike for the stupid, smarmy kid.  Memo to the kid: the phrase "pursuit of happiness" 1) comes from the Declaration of Independence, which does not actually hold any legal weight and 2) is **not** followed by the phrase "so we're going to protect you from existential problems".  What does that even mean?

Oh, and quick note to the other stupid guy in the video: the [current national debt](http://www.usdebtclock.org/) is actually 12.9 trillion, not 14 trillion.  But hey, what's a trillion or two between friends?  I mean, soon, that's going to add up to real money!

And finally, "if you like this bill you hate America" is a nice distillation of why I have not been nor will I ever be a member of the Tea Party.
