I'm rarely accused of being a sartorial masterpiece.  In fact, 90% of my wardrobe consists of witty t-shirts from [various](http://store.dieselsweeties.com/) [webcomics](http://www.topatoco.com/goats) that I [read](http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=TO&Product_Code=SHEL-MANATEE-SHIRT&Category_Code=SHEL).  However, I do, very occasionally, wear something other than jean shorts, a t-shirt, and sandals.  If you, too, would like to learn how to Dress Like a Grownup (tm), go [here](http://putthison.com/).
