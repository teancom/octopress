[A first-person account of a murder trial, by the father of the victim](http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/archive/1984/03/dunne198403?printable=true).  By coincidence, I was reading this article when I learned of [this other murder](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-costa-mesa-killings-20100529,0,7832242.story?page=1).  Juri Kibuishi, the lady mentioned in the second paragraph, is the sister of the fantastic artist [Kazu Kibuishi](http://boltcity.com/), author of Amulet, Copper, the Flight anthologies, and Daisy Cutter.  When I was reading the article about Juri and Samuel Herr's death, all I could think about is how much it sounded like a plot right from NCIS, Monk, or the Mentalist.  Except, of course, that Kazu and Dominick Dunne have to live the rest of their lives without their sister/daughter.  It doesn't get wrapped up in 42 minutes plus commercials.
