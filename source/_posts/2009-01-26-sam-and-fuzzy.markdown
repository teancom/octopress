is an epic webcomic, that's been running for years (7, I think).  So it can be scary to jump into.  But Sam Logan, the creator of [Sam and Fuzzy](http://samandfuzzy.com/), has announced that today is a perfect place to start reading, if you haven't read in the past.  And a S&F; is one of my all-time favorite webcomics, he definitely gets [ the nod](http://samandfuzzy.com/archive.php?comicID=1046).


Cuz you know, I'm the Oprah of the internet.  

I made you, Sam Logan, and I can break you! {% fn_ref 1 %} 

No?

Maybe next time.

 {% fn Yes, I'm pathetically trying to create a pseudo-feud, like the one between Sam and [Jeph](http://questionablecontent.net). No, it won't work. %}
