Fred Clark, a.k.a. [Slacktivist](http://slacktivist.typepad.com), showing in a [three](http://slacktivist.typepad.com/slacktivist/2010/05/sex-money-part-1.html) [part](http://slacktivist.typepad.com/slacktivist/2010/06/sex-money-part-2.html) [series](http://slacktivist.typepad.com/slacktivist/2010/06/sex-money-part-3.html) why he's my favorite Christian blogger, and probably my favorite philosophy inclined blogger around.  Also, I will be pointing anyone with a religious-based "reason" for anti-gay bigotry to these articles in the future.  Either they'll get it or they won't - but if they can read that and still be clueless, nothing I say will get through.  So - time saver!
