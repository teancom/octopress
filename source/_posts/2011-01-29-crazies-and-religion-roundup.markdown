Not that I'm saying they are the same thing (Hi, almost my entire family of true believers!).  Let's see... [Scientology is still a dangerous cult.](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.12/alt.scientology.war_pr.html)  [Christian Reconstructionists are scary.](http://www.slate.com/id/2264348/pagenum/all/) [The Huffington Post is the worst place to go for medical news and advice.](http://www.salon.com/news/environment/vital_signs/2009/07/30/huffington_post) [Weathermen are curiously prone to mistaking weather for climate.](http://www.cjr.org/cover_story/hot_air.php?page=all)
