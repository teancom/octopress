Although they just released [Nine Types Of Light](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UJ6XR6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B004UJ6XR6)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=1&a=B004UJ6XR6&camp=217145&creative=399349), I haven't listened to that album enough to pass judgement (so far I like it). However, I wanted to direct your attention to their previous studio album from 2008, [Dear Science](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7HQXU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B001G7HQXU)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=1&a=B001G7HQXU&camp=217145&creative=399349).

Dear Science, in a word, is a masterpiece. From the opening pounding rhythms of [Halfway Home](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4nBwwUufWE) to the closing triumphant strains of [Lover's Day](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP4pHeRSK1E), it makes me grin. Big, stupid face-splitting grins. Billed as "Art Rock", TVotR is a fantastic mix of funk, soul, R&B, and good old rock 'n roll. Heck, there's even a hint of disco in there. Anyone who can listen to the chorus of [Dancing Choose](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBhQ22CfJJ0) without at the very least tapping their toes is dead inside (and dead to me). Even when they slow it down, as they do with [Family Tree](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qipaFDNxF4s) or [DLZ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N31oFeinFY), the hooks are fantastic, and practically demand that you just put the album on repeat.

If you like this, I highly recommend [Return To Cookie Mountain](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W298AO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B000W298AO)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=1&a=B000W298AO&camp=217145&creative=399349), [Young Liars](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WAXH5I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B000WAXH5I)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=1&a=B000WAXH5I&camp=217145&creative=399349), and [Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S570KU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B000S570KU)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=1&a=B000S570KU&camp=217145&creative=399349). Each one has multiple songs that won't leave your brain for days.
