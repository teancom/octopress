[Reading this article, about a con man that stole millions from billionaire heiresses](http://www.details.com/culture-trends/news-and-politics/200909/the-worlds-greatest-con-man-helg-sgarbi?printable=true), I felt more sad than anything.  You'd like to think that the World's Greatest Con Man would be a dashing rapscallion, flirting with danger, wooing hearts, and making daring getaways.  No, he's just a little man that got greedy.  Living out of crappy hotels and constantly fearing that you'll get caught and have everything crash down around you would be immensely draining.
