[These sorts of articles](http://www.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=The+One-Man+Drug+Company&expire=&urlID=17860494&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnymag.com%2Fnews%2Ffeatures%2F16653%2F&partnerID=73272), when I come across them four years later, make me insatiably curious as to "how it turned out".  Did he ever get out of the business? Is he in jail now? Dead?  That's something that I like about This American Life - when they rerun an article, if it's applicable they'll update you as to how everyone is now.  Satisfying.
