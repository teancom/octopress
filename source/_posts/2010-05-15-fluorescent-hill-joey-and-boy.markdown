[This is a music video](http://www.fluorescenthill.com/mov/Joey.mov), of a song called "Joey" by a band called "Boy".  The music is really bad - derivative, mumbly, lacking in hooks, almost unlistenable.  So I recommend you watch the video with the sound off.  Because the animation is fantastic.  Something about the style and design just really hits all my "I love this!" buttons.  The animation was done by the [studio Fluorescent Hill](http://www.fluorescenthill.com/).  I'm off to see if they have done anything else this wonderful (hopefully in service of a more deserving client).

[Alt link to the video](http://vimeo.com/7477484), if the first one doesn't work for you.
