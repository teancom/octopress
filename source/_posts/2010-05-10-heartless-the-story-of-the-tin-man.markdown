[This video is a live-action version of the story of the Tin Man](http://vimeo.com/11431902) (from the books, not the MGM movie).  It's interesting mostly in that it illustrates a problem I've noticed with a lot of amateur 'shorts'.  The cinematography is nice, the costumes are great, the story is good (I'm a big fan of the Baum books), but it still comes off as poorly done.  And I place the blame squarely on the actors.  It is very, very, rare for productions at this level to have decent actors, and I don't understand that at all.  Ideas?
