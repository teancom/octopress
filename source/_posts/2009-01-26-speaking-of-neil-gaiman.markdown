While most of his work is not for kids (the [Sandman](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563890119?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1563890119)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gnuc-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1563890119) books are fairly intense, and [American Gods](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060558121?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060558121)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gnuc-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0060558121) isn't much better), the books he does do for kids are often fantastic.  And this has been further confirmed by the fact that [The Graveyard Book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060530928?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060530928)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gnuc-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0060530928) has just won the [Newbery Medal](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/books/27newb.html?_r=1&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink).  Congrats, [Neil](http://journal.neilgaiman.com/)!
