[Ever, ever, ever.](http://www.kdvr.com/news/kdvr-arvada-police-arrest-11yearold-over-inappropriate-stick-figure-drawing-20110221,0,7099823.story) Not when you're in the right. Not when you're sure that being cooperative and reasonable will clear things up. Don't let your kid talk to them. Just don't do it. 

And yes, that story is obviously police overreacting. But that's the point. Unless your lawyer is present, pretend you're a prisoner of war. Except you're a POW that doesn't even have to give name, rank, and serial number.
