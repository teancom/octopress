Would you believe that the [upcoming generation of kids](http://www.youtube.com/v/29lmR_357rA&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&border=1) is [spoiled and bratty](http://everything2.com/title/Ten+miles+to+school%252C+barefoot%252C+in+the+snow%252C+uphill%252C+both+ways) and feel [entitled to things that they haven't earned](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=bratty+baby+boomers)? I know! This has never happened before in the [history of the world](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lamentations%205:12&version=ESV;KJV;)! I'm pretty sure that this is the first time old people feel that way about [[Kids These Days](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0742546683?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0742546683)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gnuc-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0742546683)](http://books.google.com/books?id=s24YAAAAYAAJ&dq=freckles%20gene%20stratton%20porter%20google%20books&pg=PA105#v=snippet&q=dad&f=false).

Of course, the icing on the cake is that this is Fox and Friends accusing Mr. Rogers of being an evil man, who is (solely?) responsible for [corrupting the youth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates).
