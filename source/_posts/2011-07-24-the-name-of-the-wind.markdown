It was brought to my attention that I had not formally recommended my favorite book of the last decade, [The Name of the Wind](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0756405890/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0756405890)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=1&a=0756405890&camp=217145&creative=399369), on this blog.

There.  I've now recommended my favorite book of the last decade. The second book of the planned trilogy, [The Wise Man's Fear](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0756404738/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=0756404738)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=1&a=0756404738&camp=217145&creative=399369) is already out, and it equally awesome. Both of them reward multiple readings with wow moments and insights, especially when you realize that [Patrick Rothfuss](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/) actually knows what he's doing. I don't think there is a scene in either book that isn't absolutely necessary for the plot, though you might not believe that the first time through. Anyway, go read it. Five stars, etc.
