In [an article on Boston and the Tea Party](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/05/03/100503fa_fact_lepore?currentPage=all), there was a reference to a shocking photograph in the 70's during the protests about busing and integration.  A little bit of googling led me to [this article](http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0803/the-photograph-that-shocked-america-and-the-victim-who-stepped-outside-the-frame.html) about the picture, _The Soiling of Old Glory_, and the man in it.  Both articles are probably worth reading, but if you have to pick one, read the second (even though it's written in the style of Reader's Digest True Stories!).
