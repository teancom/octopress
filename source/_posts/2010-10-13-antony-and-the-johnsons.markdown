is my favorite [band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_and_the_Johnsons) where the [lead singer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Hegarty) is a transgender gay man.  And that's not nearly the back-handed compliment that you think it is.  I think his voice is truly wonderful and generally the only instrument that is needed for any given song.  Listen to the tracks "Hope There's Someone" and "For Today I Am A Boy" off of [I Am A Bird Now](http://www.myspace.com/antonyandthejohnsons/music/albums/i-am-a-bird-now-16805700), or "One Dove" off of ["The Crying Light"](http://www.myspace.com/antonyandthejohnsons/music/albums/the-crying-light-11921958) to see what I mean.

I say all of that, in order to tell you that a new album ["Swanlights"](http://www.swanlights.com/) dropped two days ago, and you should rush out and listen to it.  And, if it's as good as everything else he's put out, buy it.
