I apologize for the horrific page splitting, but the NYTimes is awful.  If anyone has seen the show ["The Good Guys" ](http://epguides.com/GoodGuys) (a decently smart-dumb parody of 70s and 80s cop shows), this is what happens in real life. [Death by CNN](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/23/magazine/death-on-the-cnn-curve.html?sec=health&pagewanted=all).
