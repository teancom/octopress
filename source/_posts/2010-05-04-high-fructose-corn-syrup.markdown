I'm unconvinced either way on the subject of whether HFCS is "bad" for your (vs. regular sugar), but articles [like this one](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/business/02syrup.html?pagewanted=all) are lending credence to the argument that this is just another consumer freak-out, similar to the "vaccines cause autism" scare.  Especially when I read that the referenced Princeton study has [some fairly big holes in it](http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/03/does-high-fructose-corn-syrup-make-you-fatter.ars).
