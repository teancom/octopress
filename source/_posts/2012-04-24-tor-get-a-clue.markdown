Just a quick note that Tor, a genre-heavy imprint of Macmillan, will start releasing their titles [without DRM](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/04/torforge-e-book-titles-to-go-drm-free).  As someone who has books that are locked into Kindle, iBooks, and even the Nook, this is fantastic news. A good take on this is available from [Charlie Stross](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/04/more-on-drm-and-ebooks.html).
