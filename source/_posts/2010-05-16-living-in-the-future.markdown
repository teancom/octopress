[The really great future, where this sad but sweet video](http://nofatclips.com/02010/05/11/losing-light/The%20Ghost%20in%20You%20-%20Losing%20Light_sml.mp4) can be created entirely on a [Nintendo DSi](http://www.myspace.com/singingsirens).  Yes, literally, hand-held gaming platforms are flexible and powerful enough to animate an entire music video.  How cool is that?
