Anyone that wants to understand why there is a problem of unwed mothers on welfare, crime, and unemployment in the poor black community, please read [this article](http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2003/the_marriage_cure).  And anyone that thinks all you need to do is work hard to escape that life, needs to read [this article](http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2003/the_marriage_cure).  And anyone who has an ounce of human compassion in their body should probably not read [this article](http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2003/the_marriage_cure), because you will be seriously depressed by the end.
