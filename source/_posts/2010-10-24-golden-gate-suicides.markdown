I think the pull quote from [this article](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/10/13/031013fa_fact?currentPage=all) is this:

As he crossed the chord in flight, Baldwin recalls, “I instantly realized that everything in my life that I’d thought was unfixable was totally fixable—except for having just jumped.”
