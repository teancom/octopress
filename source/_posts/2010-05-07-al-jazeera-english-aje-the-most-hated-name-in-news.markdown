[After reading this article about Al Jazeera](http://www.walrusmagazine.com/print/2009.10-media-the-most-hated-name-in-news/), I was inspired to add [AJE](http://english.aljazeera.net/) to my [RSS feeds](http://google.com/reader/view/).  It's only been a couple of days, but so far I haven't noticed any particular anti-American bias.  I'm also seeing that there is a lot more going on in the world than I had previously noticed.  We'll see how long I keep up with it, though.
