I've never been a big fan of riding bikes.  The seat is always uncomfortable, I have a hard time finding the right gear, and I hate pedaling up hills.

Which makes [this story](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/sports/playmagazine/05robicpm.html?pagewanted=all) even more unbelievable.  This guy is (literally!) insane.
