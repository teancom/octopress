Apparently it's going to be more "[Decemberist](http://decemberists.com)-y" than their last album ([The Crane Wife](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HKDEEW?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000HKDEEW)).  You can sign up to download a "single" from the upcoming album [Hazards Of Love](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LK1LA6?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001LK1LA6).  While it's nice that they're getting back to their "roots" (and I do adore [Castaways and Cutouts](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008XS4D?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00008XS4D) and [Picaresque](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007M22S4?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0007M22S4)), here's a good example of why I always love The Decemberists, and probably always will:
