Speaking of things that I just missed, Kurosawa turned 100 four days ago.  If you aren't familiar with his work, then boy - do I envy you.  You have some mind-blowing cinematic experiences ahead of you.  If you do know his movies (Seven Samurai, Ikiru, Stray Dog, Yojimbo, Rashomon, and many more), then you already know how fantastic he was.  Every movie lover should own at least 5 of his movies.  In fact, I'm probably going to ask for [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NOZUEW?ie=UTF8&tag=gnuc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002NOZUEW)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gnuc-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002NOZUEW) as my only Christmas present this year.  Which, at $280 is probably still not in our budget.  But man, do I wish it was.
