Not really [news](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/20/us-minnesota-prayer-idUSTRE74J7CS20110520), right? Actually, my first reaction to that article was how strange it is that here, in 2011, we have chaplains for state legislatures. As the guy says in his prayer, it's "non-denominational" - i.e., it's a prayer for all _kinds_ of Christians. They also play both kinds of music - country and western.
