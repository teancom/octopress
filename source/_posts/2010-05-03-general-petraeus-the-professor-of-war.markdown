A [hagiographic article on the General](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2010/05/petraeus-201005?printable=true).  Interesting enough on it's own, but I like how none of the politicians mentioned come out looking good.  Required reading for anyone who's ever thought that we just need to be tougher to win in Iraq and Afghanistan, or if you thought the whole Abu Ghraib scandal was overblown.
