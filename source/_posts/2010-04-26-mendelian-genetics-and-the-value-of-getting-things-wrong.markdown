A good overview on how [Mendel got almost everything wrong](http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/04/breaking-mendels-laws-the-value-of-informative-errors.ars), and still managed to be right.  Also a good example of why I read [Arstechnica](http://arstechnica.com).  They don't constrain themselves to just covering the latest "geek news".  I like ending the day just a little smarter than I started it, and Ars helps with that.
