[Slacktivist's take on the latest news.](http://slacktivist.typepad.com/slacktivist/2011/02/cricket-cricket-tumbleweed.html) And yes, I'm linking to Slacktivist again. He's my token Christian blogger - I link to him to show that I'm open-minded, even though he believes in stuff that I think is nonsense. That he writes clearly and convincingly about politics, religion, and morality is a nice bonus.
