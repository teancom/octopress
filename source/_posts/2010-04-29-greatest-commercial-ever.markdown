I had run across this before but forgot to post it.  What [Errol Morris](http://twitter.com/errolmorris/status/12329183511) calls the Greatest Commercial Ever.  I'm not sure about that, but it is [pretty awesome](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-RLqLx1iYI).

Thanks to [Kottke](http://kottke.org/10/04/the-best-tv-commercial-ever) for reminding me of it.
