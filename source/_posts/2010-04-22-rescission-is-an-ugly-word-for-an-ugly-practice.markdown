But I wouldn't worry about it.  As one of the first commenters on [this article](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63L2LS20100422) points out, they're happy with their coverage, so the story should have been about that.

I mean, it's not like the two ladies in the lede were happy with **their** coverage, right up until it was cancelled.  You know, as soon as they needed it.  No, I'm sure they did something wrong.  They were probably bad.  I mean, you don't get cancer unless you did something bad, right? Ate the wrong food? Maybe they didn't check themselves often enough.  Yeah, they probably deserved the cancer.  No wonder WellPoint dropped them.  Really, they were just doing the ladies a favor.  I mean, who wants to live if you have cancer?
