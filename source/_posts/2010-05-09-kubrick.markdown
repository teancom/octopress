[A decently long article by one of Stanley Kubrick's friends](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/classic/features/kubrick-199908?printable=true), about the man himself.  I don't know if Kubrick is one of my favorite directors, per se, (I haven't seen more than a handful of his movies) but the ones I have seen I adore beyond all reason (2001 and Dr. Strangelove, for example).
